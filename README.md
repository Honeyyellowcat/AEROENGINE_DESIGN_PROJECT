# AA 461 Airbreathing Propulsion Project
Welcome to the AA 461 Airbreathing Propulsion Project for the Winter Quarter 2024. This project focuses on the design of a gas turbine engine core, comprising the compressor, combustor, and turbine components, to meet specific performance, cost-efficiency, and design considerations.

## Objective
The objective of the project is to design a gas turbine engine core that optimizes performance, maintains acceptable turbine inlet temperatures, identifies cost-efficient design solutions, and handles specified mass flow at designated inlet conditions.

### Project Details
Teams
Each Project Team is composed of two students. Please email JCH by Wednesday, February 14, with your proposed team.

### Analysis
Utilize existing software for the analysis of the compressor, combustor, and turbine. The software (EOP2) can be found online at EOP2 Software. Utilize COMPR and TURBN programs for compressor and turbine performance analysis, respectively. The CEARUN program can be employed for combustion analysis.

### Written Report
Prepare a concise written report summarizing your work. The report should include a problem statement, approach, inputs used, selected design point rationale, description of key non-software steps, performance plots, and a proposed configuration sketch. Aim for a report length of approximately 8 pages, including figures.

### roject Evaluation
The Project contributes up to 40 Homework points for each team member. Project Reports are due on Friday, March 1.
